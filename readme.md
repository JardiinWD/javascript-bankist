# Javascript - Bankist

This Web app simulates an online account manager where users can log in with their username and pin. The application was created step by step following Jonas Schmedtmann's online bootcamp.

## **Tag head**

Inside the `head` tag there are all the links necessary for the page `style`. The links are:

- My main stylesheet.
- Link to the Poppins font taken from Google.

## **script.js**

This is my main `script file` where all the `DOM manipulations` applied to my markup reside. The whole file is divided into `regions`, in order to keep the code `cleaner and tidier`.
